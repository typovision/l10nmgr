	* Added --noFlush flag to command line cleaner tool, extended --pid to accept comma separated list of PIDs
	* Added Context Sensitive Item "L10Nmgr tools" which expands to a submenu with items 'Create priority', 'Manage priorities','Update Index','Flush Translations'. These functions were requested by Dassault.
	* For flushing to really work for flexforms (clearing the vDEFbase value) it needs the latest TYPO3 core for a modication to tcemain (clear_flexFormData_vDEFbase)

	* Committed work I did on this extension for Dassault in August and October. This includes:
	* A "Translation Tasks" module which is destined to be a "task center" for translators including listing of explicitly set priorities by webmasters.
	* An translation index table which helps us to make a overview of what translations are pending. This also needs more adaption.
	* Some of this may depend on core-hooks which are upcoming.
	* Expecting to finish these features for a "first real version" in January 2008 for Dassault. Until then, use at own risk.
