	* Added word and char count for calculation of translation costs (experimental!). XML export only. (funct wordCount)
	* &nbsp; now substituted before XML export as it is not XML conform.
	* Changed XML-Format: Now includes grouping element <pageGrp id="$pid"> to group translatable data. Needed for access to page context in CAT-Tools.
	* XML-Format now contains format version number (needed for compatibility issues)
	* Added download links for settings files in XML mode (temporary - should later be configurable and included in l10n package)

	* Committed work I did on this extension for Dassault in August and October. This includes:
	* A "Translation Tasks" module which is destined to be a "task center" for translators including listing of explicitly set priorities by webmasters.
	* An translation index table which helps us to make a overview of what translations are pending. This also needs more adaption.
	* Some of this may depend on core-hooks which are upcoming.
	* Expecting to finish these features for a "first real version" in January 2008 for Dassault. Until then, use at own risk.
