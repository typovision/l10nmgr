2012-02-08 Andreas Otto <andreas@otto-hanika.de>
	* [~FEATURE] Add configuration enable_neverHideAtCopy. TYPO3 4.5 changed the standard behaviour for copied records to be hidden. Technicaly a translation of a record is a copy and would result in translations not being visible.

Just imagine you imported the translation for a larger website and you now have to go through every page and enable the translated records manualy.

	* A "Translation Tasks" module which is destined to be a "task center" for translators including listing of explicitly set priorities by webmasters.
	* An translation index table which helps us to make a overview of what translations are pending. This also needs more adaption.
	* Some of this may depend on core-hooks which are upcoming.
	* Expecting to finish these features for a "first real version" in January 2008 for Dassault. Until then, use at own risk.

2007-05-21 Andreas Otto <andreas.otto@dkd.de>
