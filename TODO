	* TODO and/or nice to have

	* CDATA is a real problem for CAT-Tools (from calculating translation service offers to translation itself). Should be fixed as soon as possible. Remains a problem for HTML content elements
	* Add switch for field types for XML import/export (currently only hard coded for bodytext field)
	* Settings files for XML output for major CAT tools (missing: across, déjàVu)
	* Documentation (Translation into German and Spanish can be done at Saarland University )
	* Translation of frontend labels
	* Workflow support with email notification and download center (Kasper working on it?)
	* Analysis of volume to be translated
	* Automatic substitution of links to documents in fileadmin? Integrating translated PDFs can take quite some time. Same for images.
	* Automatic substitution of L= parameters (as advanced option?)
	* Add option to exclude table fields (columns) from export (e.g. header_link)
	* Export to l10n package with documentation and settings files?
